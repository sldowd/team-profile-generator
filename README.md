# team-profile-generator

This is a command line application built to generate a website that displays information on a team of employees. When the application runs, the user is prompted by a series of questions on the command line to collect information about the employee team including name, employee id, email address, as well as github username for engineers, school for interns, and office number for managers. That information is then fed into an HTML file that can be viewed on a browser.

The main programming language of this application is JavaScript. The application runs in Node. Tests were built and executed using the Jest package. Command line prompts were coded using the Inquirer package. Bootstrap was used for the stylesheet of the HTML file.
